#PART 1:

#1.1) Enter the final exam scores provided in Chapter 2, Problem #5 (located on page 18) as a vector called vect (1 pt)
```{r}
c()
vect <- c(73, 74, 92, 98, 100, 72, 74, 85, 76, 94, 89, 73, 76, 99)
vect
```
#1.2) Compute the mean (0.5 pt) and sd (0.5 pt) of vect 
# Mean
```{r}
mean(vect)
```
# Standard Deviation
```{r}
sd(vect, na.rm = TRUE)
```
#1.3) Using the Normal distribution: 
	#A) What is the probability of a student scoring less than a 90 on the final exam (1 pt)
	#B) What is the probability of a student scoring between a 70 and  85 on the final exam (2 pt)
# Part A
# Uses the mean and SD to find prob.
```{r}
pnorm(90, 83.92857, 11.02769)- (pnorm(90, 83.92857, 11.02769)-pnorm(89, 83.92857, 11.02769))
```
# or 
```{r}
pnorm(89, 83.92857, 11.02769)
```
# Check
```{r}
qnorm(0.6771995, 83.92857, 11.02769)
```
# Part B
```{r}
pnorm(85, 83.92857, 11.02769) - pnorm(69, 83.92857, 11.02769)
```
# Cannot really check, but can reality check
# Find percentage of everything under 85, then from that, subtract possibility of under
# 69, to between 70-85

#1.EC) Using the Normal distribution: What score does a student need to be in the top 5%
```{r}
qnorm(0.95, 83.92857, 11.02768)
```
#PART 2:
#2.1) Do Problem #24 from Chapter 4 (located on page 60) using the R functions you learned
	#NOTE: The correct answers are in the back of the book, I want to see that you can get/verify these answers using R
# n = 10 p = 0.4
#A) (1 pt)
# p(0)
```{r}
dbinom(0, 10, 0.4)
```
#B) (1 pt)
# p(x<=3)
```{r}
pbinom(3, 10, 0.4)
```
# work
```{r}
dbinom(3, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(2, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(1, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(0, 10, 0.4)
```
#C) (1 pt)
# p(x<3)
```{r}
pbinom(3, 10, 0.4) - dbinom(3, 10, 0.4)
```
# work 
```{r}
dbinom(2, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(1, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(0, 10, 0.4)
```
#D) (1 pt)	
# p(x>4)
```{r}
1-pbinom(4, 10, 0.4)
```
# work
```{r}
dbinom(5, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(6, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(7, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(8, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(9, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(10, 10, 0.4)
```
#E) (1 pt)	
# p(2<=x<=5)
```{r}
pbinom(5, 10, 0.4) - (pbinom(2, 10, 0.4) - dbinom(2, 10, 0.4))
```
# work
```{r}
dbinom(2, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(3, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(4, 10, 0.4)+dbinom(5, 10, 0.4)
```
#2.EC) Think up a binomial probability example and use R to find the probability (1 pt) 
  
# Sam Darnold is a beast QB for USC. His passing rate is 67.2% last season. Out of 
# 10 passes, what is the probability that he will make 3 to 8 passes?
```{r}
pbinom(8, 10, 0.672) - (pbinom(3, 10, 0.672) - dbinom(3, 10, 0.672))
```
# work 
```{r}
dbinom(3, 10, 0.672)+dbinom(4, 10, 0.672)+dbinom(5, 10, 0.672)+dbinom(6, 10, 0.672)+dbinom(7, 10, 0.672)+dbinom(8, 10, 0.672)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
